  + Access level support (also for tiered
    access to global configuration options
    vs. the need to edit and restart the

DOWNLOAD
  You can download the latest version of
the phpDHCPAdmin application at the following
URL: http://phpdhcpadmin.sourceforge.net

INSTALLATION
  To install the application you will need
to extract the .tgz archive into your
webservers root folder:
%> tar zxvf phpDHCPAdmin-0.9.5-beta.tgz

CONFIGURATION
  In order to begin using the application
you will need to configure it specifically
for your web server environment, create the
necessary database tables and setup a simple
crontab entry as a root user. The three
steps are outlined below:

1. Edit the configuration file 'inc.config.php'
located in the 'scripts/' directory.

The necessary configuration directives specific
for your operating environment are:

$defined['hostname'] <-- This is the domain or web
server name (ex. http://phpdhcpadmin.com or 192.168.0.1)

$defined['username'] <-- This is the username that
needs to be created on your MySQL database.

$defined['password'] <-- This is the password
associated with the user you are accessing the
database with

$defined['virpath'] <-- This is the path to the
installation folder (ex. /webroot/htdocs/phpDHCPAmin)

2. Accompanying this distibution is a .sql file
you can utilize to create the necessary tables.

An example of importing this file is as follows;
%> mysql -u root -p < /path/setup/phpDHCPAdmin-0.9.5-beta.sql

Or you can utilize the installation script located
in the 'setup' folder to help you setup the
database schema as well as the configuration
directives.

3. Point any web browser to the newly installed
application and login with the user 'admin' and no
password.

** You should setup an administrative user
password but there should always be only 1 user
associated with the admin group as this user is
similar to a root user on common linux OS's.

4. Create a crontab entry which will attempt to
detect if the dhcpd.conf file has changed and
restart the service.

*/1 * * * * php /path/cron.restart.dhcpd.php 2&>1 /dev/null

5. You will also need to set write permissions on the
'conf' folder.
%> chmod -R 0755 conf

SUPPORT & BUG REPORTS
  For support options you can join the mailing
list located at http://phpdhcpadmin.sourceforge.net

  If you run into errors when 'restarting' the
dhcpd service you may need to 1. set write permissions
on the 'conf' directory and create a crontab entry to
run as the root user which would execute the file
'/path/to/phpDHCPAdmin/bin/cron.restart.dhcpd.php'. An
example follows:
*/1 * * * * php /path/cron.restart.dhcpd.php 2&>1 /dev/null
